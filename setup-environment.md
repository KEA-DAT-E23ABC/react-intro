# Setup dev environment

Before diving into React, we need to set up our environment. Here’s what you’ll need:

## Required Tools

- Install npm and LTS version of [node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/prebuilt-installer) (note npm is included in the installation of node).
- Open your terminal and verify the installation by running the following commands:

```bash
node -v
npm -v
```

If both return version numbers, you're good to go!

## Recommended Tools

To improve productivity and workflow, I recommend the following tools:

- Install [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
- When VS Code has been installed, install the following extensions for VS Code:
  - [ESlint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint):
  - [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer)
